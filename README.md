# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChrisMcGoran, I work in analytics and tech risk. I am interested in risk and ways to analyse it using different methodologys and different tools. I am interested in risk and ways to control that risk. I use python, but would regard myself as a noob when it comes to python so stil believe I am still ðŸŒ± learning and improving. I am also very interested in ðŸŒ± learning Rust as a more efficient and safe way of analysing data and risk.

I am looking to collaborate on any python or rust projects involving risk and methods of analysing risk and how to control that risk. 

You can reach me here, on twitter @chrismcg83.
